<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
<h2><p>Giving blood saves lives. But it's always in high demand. Our lifesaving service is required every day and we need 200000 new donors a year to meet demand.
A website www.blooddonation.com has been designed to build an Indian database of blood donors,
 which will help in saving lives of those who are in immediate need of blood. We humbly request you to join 
 us in this noble endeavor by registering yourself in the site as a donor, and donate blood whenever required.
A blood donor must be deemed healthy before donating blood. ... A person who donates blood burns about 650 
calories with every pint donated, as the body has to work to replenish itself. Though 
there are many benefits to donating blood just one time, the people who benefit most from blood donations are regular donors.</p><h2>
